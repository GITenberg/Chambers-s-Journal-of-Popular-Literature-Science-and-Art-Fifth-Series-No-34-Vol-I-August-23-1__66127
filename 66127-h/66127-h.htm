</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Exact</span> statistics cannot be obtained of the number
of grouse annually killed upon the Moors; but
estimates of a reliable kind have occasionally
been published, from which we learn, that as
many as five hundred thousand annually reach
the markets, in addition to the numbers given
away as presents or ‘consumed on the premises.’
That this figure, large as it may appear to those
who are not well versed in sporting matters, is
not exaggerated, will be apparent when we
mention on good authority, that on some days
of August as many as sixteen thousand grouse
(single birds) have been received by the London
wholesale dealers; and that for days in succession,
supplies of from two to ten thousand birds
reach the metropolis to be sold to the retailers.
But no matter how great may be the slaughter
on the grouse-moors in any given year, the
death-roll of the following season is frequently
even greater. The grouse, in common with many
other birds, protected or otherwise, is endowed
with great powers of reproduction; and even
when disease has on some occasions played such
havoc with the birds, that on some vast stretches
of heather only half-a-dozen brace may have been
left to multiply and replenish, yet, in two or
three seasons they will have increased with such
rapidity as to be more numerous on that ground
than they ever were before. Stories of nests
being seen with as many as fifteen, sixteen, and
eighteen eggs have often gone the round of the
newspapers; but the usual number of eggs
annually laid by each female may be fixed at
not less than from seven to nine.</p>

<p>But the chief question is not so much the
number of eggs produced, as the number of
birds which are hatched and the percentage of
these that become food for powder. The grouse
has a hundred enemies lying in wait to do mischief—to
destroy the nests, suck the eggs, or kill
the tender brood; nor are the parents spared,
when the enemy is their superior in strength
and cunning. Let all who have the chance walk
the heather in June and July with an observant
eye, and note the damage which has been done
during the breeding season by foes, both quadruped
and biped. See yonder carrion crows,
how they sweep down on those spots of heather
which are populous with nests and young ones!
And what a delicious titbit for stoat and weasel
do the day-old ‘cheepers’ afford! Many a gallant
battle will be fought by the male grouse on
behalf of his mate and her eggs, as he does not
hesitate to defend them from the greedy crow,
nor is afraid even of the bloodsucking weasel.
Whenever danger threatens the home of his little
family, the cock-grouse is up in arms, ready to
do all he can for the protection of madame
and her chicks. Before twenty-four hours have
elapsed, the nest in which the young ones have
been hatched seems to be no longer necessary
for rearing purposes, and is consequently forsaken;
and the parents and their family take
to a nomadic life, travelling about with a rapidity
which is wonderful, considering the tender age
of the brood. It is also a curious circumstance
that one or two birds of almost every nest come
to maturity at an earlier date than their brothers
and sisters—the percentage that displays this
precocity of growth being about two out of every
seven; and we have been told by shepherds
that these are ‘the cock’s own birds.’</p>

<p>Both parents are attentive to their young ones,
and tend and nurse them with assiduity and
care; but the birds which are specially looked
after by the male, come on, it is thought, the
quickest. The father of the brood, however,
seldom takes in hand to pay attention to more
than three members of his family, no matter
how numerous may be the total number hatched.
The cock-grouse is a brave parent; but in addition
to being courageous, he is cunning as well,
and in times of danger frequently outwits his
enemies by his superior resources. He is often
able, when his brood is threatened, to find a safe
hiding-place for them, or is skilful in devising
other modes of escape from sudden danger.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding all the care which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">{530}</span>
parent birds are able to bestow on their young
ones, the percentage of mortality, as in the case
of other wild animals, is always considerable.
In the first place, there are ‘the elements’ to
do battle with. A stormy spring-time will
delay pairing; the birds are late ere they
begin their work of egg-laying, and deluges
of rain will wash the eggs out of the nests
or drown the tender nestlings. Nevertheless,
there is still a head of game left for the sportsman;
and after the moors have been industriously
trodden for a few weeks, there may yet
remain a stock of birds sufficiently numerous to
insure an ample supply for the sportsmen of the
future.</p>

<p>The exact number of moorfowl that a given
acreage of moor will feed and breed cannot
be stated except by way of an estimate. Some
shootings are much better stocked than others of
similar size, probably because the breeding accommodation
is good and the food more plentiful.
To insure good sport on the Twelfth and subsequently,
much requires to be done to a moor.
It must be traversed by keepers, whose duty it
is to trap and otherwise destroy the ‘vermin;’
patches of old heather must be burned to insure
the growth of young shoots, upon which grouse
delight to feed; and poachers and other trespassers
must be dealt with. In some places where
the heather is well cared for and systematically
burned, and where the vermin are looked
after, the return will be much more liberal
than on moors that have been left to themselves,
though, strangely enough, in some districts,
one of several contiguous moors will often
produce a greater percentage of birds than
can be obtained on any of the others. Big bags
quickly filled are the order of the opening day,
and instances of modern sport will bear us
out when we say that two guns have been
known to kill two hundred and eighty single
birds on the first or second day of the season;
and we have known a small party to have
shot in the course of ten days as many as nine
hundred and fifty-two brace. On some of the
English grouse moors, still larger bags are occasionally
recorded. On the Wemergill moor,
belonging to Sir Frederick A. Millbank, there
were shot in four days in 1882 by seven guns on
the first two days, and by four guns on the next
two, four thousand eight hundred and thirty-three
grouse. Some twenty years ago, a good sportsman
was well contented with his sixteen or
twenty brace of birds; but we shoot faster and
closer nowadays.</p>

<p>All who have had occasion to take a moor
for themselves or friends, know that the pastime
of grouse-shooting is yearly becoming more and
more expensive. ‘The heather is cheap enough,’
we are sometimes told; ‘it ranges from about
sevenpence to eighteenpence an acre;’ and that
certainly does not appear to be an expensive
matter; but the extras mount up to a tidy sum
before the season closes. No good shooting with
a comfortable residence upon it can be obtained
much under two hundred and fifty pounds for
the season; but that sum, with travelling expenses
hither and thither of family and servants, the
payment of keepers and gillies, the entertainment
of guests, and other items of expenditure,
becomes largely augmented. There are always,
of course, shootings in the market at the most
varied prices, from a share of a moor at perhaps
twenty-five pounds, to a stretch of heather with
palatial residence, and perhaps salmon-fishing,
that costs a thousand pounds and upwards.
Various terms are occasionally exacted besides
the payment of a given sum by way of
rent—the number of birds to be shot is
specified, and the period of occupation strictly
laid down in the articles of lease. There are,
however, moors which are let on a pretty
long lease for good rentals, where the tenant
is, as it may be, put on honour, and shoots as
few or as many birds as he pleases, it being
understood, that when he quits the ground, he
shall leave upon the heather as good a breeding
stock as he found.</p>

<p>Yearly, or, as they may rather be called,
season tenants, have often proved somewhat
unscrupulous as to this factor of grouse-moor
economy, and have been known to shoot every
bird that could be found. It is because of such
dishonourable conduct that landlords or factors
have been compelled to lay down stringent conditions
as to the number of birds that shall
be slain during the shooting season. There are
persons who make it their business to rent
a moor in order that they may completely
despoil the heather of its feathered treasures.
In some instances of this kind of dealing, a
large stretch of moorland has been depopulated
in the course of a few days, the lessee
being assisted in his deadly work by a band
of confederates, and the grouse hurried into the
market—this being of course the intention of
all concerned from the beginning. It is the
next tenant of that shooting who suffers. Both
laird and factor being very likely ignorant of
what has occurred, the ground is again let for
the season; and the tenant—who probably had
omitted the precaution of previously visiting the
moor to satisfy himself as to the chances of
coming sport—finding that birds are exceedingly
scarce, is naturally very much annoyed.
In consequence of such fraudulent practices,
sportsmen rarely take a moor without some
guarantee of the quantum of sport they are
likely to obtain; while on the other hand
lairds are yearly becoming more particular as to
the character of offering tenants.</p>

<p>The expenses of a shooting are nowadays so
great, that it is the custom for nearly all
who take a moor to send a considerable number
of their birds to market. In the days of
our grandfathers, it would have been thought
mean to sell one’s grouse, most of the birds
which then were shot being distributed as
presents. But in those days, shooting was truly
a ‘sport,’ and was leisurely gone about, with
the result that, in a comparative sense, not more
perhaps than a third of the number now killed
were shot. It must, however, be borne in mind
that at the period indicated, say fifty years
ago, breech-loaders had not been invented; the
same facilities for reaching distant markets were
not in existence; the modes of steam transport,
now so well developed, were only in their
infancy; and the rents of moors were not,
speaking roundly, more than a fourth of what
they are to-day. Ten or twelve thousand acres
of productive heather might have been leased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">{531}</span>
in the days of our grandfathers for little more
than a hundred pounds a year, and probably
not above seventy or eighty, or at most a hundred
brace of birds would be shot upon it—no
more being needed, the London and other
grouse markets not being then in existence, at
anyrate not in the active way that we find
them to-day. Seeing that fifty years ago there
was even a greater expanse of heather than
there is now, it is curious to note the increased
abundance of game, though the apparent increase
may partly be accounted for by the
modern methods of suppressing moorland
‘vermin.’ Formerly, hawks, carrion crows,
stoats, and other grouse-foes, roamed the moors
comparatively unmolested, and doubtless committed
great havoc. Nowadays, gun and trap
destroy those creatures, and secure a larger
head of game to the sportsman. That being
so, grouse are sent in large quantities to market
in order to be sold, much to the benefit of the
general public.</p>

<p>Grouse commerce is of varied incidence. There
are persons, for instance, who before the shooting
season begins will contract with the lessees of
moors to receive all the birds they can shoot, at
a fixed price per brace. These contractors take
their chance of making a profit by sending the
grouse they receive to London, Liverpool, Manchester,
&amp;c., to be sold for what they will bring.
It depends on the season how they fare. If the
supply is large, the price falls, and little profit
may in consequence be realised. On the other
hand, if the supply is less than the demand,
then prices rise and profits are insured. Some
lessees consign their birds to a dealer, and agree
to take the market price—a commission being
allowed on sales. The prices vary according to
the quality and plumpness of the birds. Thus,
we have seen a large number of the return lists
from big salesmen in London and Manchester, in
which the prices range from 7s. 6d. and 6s. 9d.
for single birds, down to 1s. 3d. The following
salesman’s note speaks for itself: ten at 7s. 6d.;
twenty at 6s. 6d.; thirty at 5s. 9d.; forty-nine at
4s. 6d.; twenty at 3s. 9d.; twenty at 2s.; twelve
at 1s. 6d.—total, one hundred and sixty-one, all
priced, be it noted, as single birds. These will
have been sent in hampers, and will most likely
be disposed of by auction by the salesmen to
the West-end poultrymen and game-dealers of
London; who in turn will fix the price of
the finest of the birds at probably a guinea a
brace. The returns for sales are very varied; at
times the market is so glutted with grouse, that
none of them will bring more, perhaps, than
two shillings or half-a-crown. Such loads of
grouse in plentiful seasons now reach our
populous towns and great cities by the 13th
and 14th of August, that this delicious game
may be bought at quite a moderate figure.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the great bulk of the
birds which are annually killed reach the
markets before the close of the month named;
and we regret to say that despite of every
care being exercised, poached birds are still
plentiful—so plentiful that they hurt the
market. The ingenuity of the poachers is
notorious; they will sweep a moor a few days
before ‘the Twelfth,’ and then manage to place
the spoil in the hands of such dealers as will
purchase, in spite of all the watchfulness of
the authorities. This pernicious system often
accounts for grouse being exposed for sale on
the <i>morning</i> of the Twelfth.</p>

<p>The amount of money which is annually
expended in grouse-shooting and deer-stalking
cannot be less than from one to two millions
sterling. The sporting rental of Scotland has
been estimated to be not less than half a million
per annum; and the amount of money paid
for living, and for the wages of servants,
entertainment of guests, as well as what is
expended in travel, must be at least four
times the sum named. It has been said
that Sir Walter Scott <i>made</i> Scotland, in the
sense of conferring upon it that celebrity
which caused it to become a profitable show.
Not only did he describe its scenery of cloud-capt
mountain and placid lake, but he made
classic its sports and pastimes, and sent thousands
from all parts of the world to stalk its
deer, kill its salmon, and shoot its moorfowl.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLIII.—OTHER PEOPLE’S MONEY.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> an early hour Wrentham was with him
again, as smartly dressed and hat as glossy as
if he had been on his way to a garden-party,
or Ascot, which was the more probable expedition
for him to be intent on. Whatever he
thought of Philip’s haggard looks and ruffled
dress, which indicated that he had been up all
night, he affected not to perceive these signs
of a mind perturbed.</p>

<p>‘Any letter this morning?’ he inquired after a
cheerful greeting.</p>

<p>‘No letter from Mr Shield,’ answered Philip,
comprehending the real meaning of the question.</p>

<p>‘Droll,’ muttered Wrentham, for an instant
allowing his disappointment to appear. ‘Should
have thought he would not have failed to write
last night, knowing what a corner you are in.
Never mind. I daresay he means to send the
answer by messenger, and he can’t back out
of giving you a lift, seeing that he is pledged
to do so.’</p>

<p>‘He may be annoyed—he has reason enough
to be so—and may refuse. What then?’</p>

<p>Wrentham shrugged his shoulders and smiled
complacently.</p>

<p>‘Why, then, my dear old man, you must go
in for the whitewash.’</p>

<p>‘The what?’</p>

<p>‘The whitewash. Go through the Court—the
Bankruptcy Court.... Oh, you need not look
so glum over it, for it is quite the pleasantest
way of getting out of a difficulty, and every
sensible man does it. I’ve been through the
Court twice myself, and only want to go through
it a third time in order to be certain of success.
I assure you the Court of Bankruptcy is the
gateway to fortune. Look at’——</p>

<p>He ran over a long list of notable commercial
men who had undergone ‘the whitewash,’ as he
termed it, in his flippant way, who had never
done any good until they underwent the ordeal,
and who were now wealthy and respected. He
spoke of them with genuine admiration, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">{532}</span>
concluded with the declaration of his ambition to
go through the Court once again: then, success
was certain.</p>

<p>Philip stared at him. Surely the man would
not dare to jest at such a time as this; and
yet the species of consolation he offered him
was very like a cruel jest. But it was impossible
to look at Wrentham’s cheerful confident
countenance and doubt his sincerity.</p>

<p>‘If the object I had in view had been different
from what it is,’ Philip said coldly, ‘and
if the money had been my own, probably I
should not have felt the loss as I do.’</p>

<p>‘That’s just where I don’t understand you.
The beauty of it to me is that the money was
not your own—if it had been, I should have
sung another tune. But it’s nonsense to think
that anybody can be desperately upset when they
are only losing other people’s money.’</p>

<p>Philip turned weariedly to the window: it
was a hopeless endeavour to get this man to
understand his sentiments on this subject.</p>

<p>‘Come, come; cheer up, old man—things never
turn out so bad as they look. I know Shield
has plenty, and he’ll stump up. If he doesn’t,
why, there’s the Court open to you, and you can
start again fresher than ever.’</p>

<p>‘We need not talk further on the subject at
present,’ said Philip, turning round. ‘I shall
wait till eleven o’clock, and if there is no message
by that time, I go to Willowmere. Should I
not call at the office on my way back, come
here in the afternoon and let me know what is
doing.’</p>

<p>‘All right. I am glad you are going to see
Miss Heathcote. I believe she can give us some
useful information—if she chooses.’</p>

<p>The mixture of good-nature and selfishness
as displayed in Wrentham was at that time
most painful to Philip. He felt as if his noble
purpose had been dragged down to the level of
a swindle; and if he had been a conscience-stricken
swindler, he could not have endured
sharper stings than his morbidly exaggerated
sense of failure thrust into him.</p>

<p>Eleven o’clock struck, and still no message had
come from Mr Shield.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After breathing the close atmosphere of Wrentham’s
unscrupulous counsels, it was a relief
to be out in the meadows again, although
they were covered with snow: the crisp tinkle
of the river in the frosty air was delightful music
to his weary ears; and the trees, with their
skeleton arms decked and tipped with delicate
white glistening in the sunlight, refreshed his
eyes.</p>

<p>‘Eh, lad, what is’t that has come to thee?’
was the greeting of Dame Crawshay. ‘Art
poorly?’</p>

<p>‘Ay, poor enough; for I am afraid I have lost
everything.’</p>

<p>‘Nay, nay, Philip; that cannot be—thou hast
not had time for it,’ she said in distress and
wonderment as they went into the oak parlour.</p>

<p>‘Time enough to prove my incapacity for
business,’ he answered bitterly; ‘and my grand
scheme will burst like a soap-bubble, unless Mr
Shield comes to the rescue.’</p>

<p>‘And never doubt he will,’ she said earnestly,
her own mind troubled at the moment by the
knowledge of Mr Shield’s intentions, which she
could not communicate. The sight of Philip’s
face convinced her that the ordeal was too
severe.</p>

<p>‘I sent to him yesterday afternoon asking
help, and he has given no answer yet.’</p>

<p>‘But he will do it. Take heart and trust
him. But there must be something wrong about
this, Philip—that such a fortune should slip
through thy fingers so quickly.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, there is something wrong; and I am
trying to find out what it is, and where it is.
I <i>will</i> find it out before long. But I am anxious
to get back to town, and I want to see Madge
for a few minutes. That was what brought me
out.’</p>

<p>‘There’s a pity now! She’s gone to London
all in a hurry after the post came in. I thought
she was going to see thee.’</p>

<p>‘I sent no letter last night,’ said Philip, chilled
with chagrin and disappointment. ‘Did she say
that she was going to see me?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, and with good news; but if she finds
thee looking as glum as thou art now, she’ll be
frightened;’ and the dame tried to smile. Her
soft kindly voice soothed him, although her words
conveyed little comfort.</p>

<p>‘Where is Uncle Dick?’ he inquired after a
brief pause.</p>

<p>‘He is away to the inspector about the cattle
he is sending to Smithfield. I do hope he’ll
get a prize; he has so set his heart on it.’</p>

<p>At any other time, Philip would have cordially
sympathised with that good wish: at present,
he scarcely noticed it.</p>

<p>‘I shall not see him to-day, then.... What
time did Madge go?’</p>

<p>‘By the nine o’clock train. Stay and have a
bite of something, lad. I do not believe thou
hast been eating properly, or thou’dst be better
able to bear this pother. It will be ready in
ten minutes.’</p>

<p>‘Not now, Aunt Hessy, thank you,’ was his
reply to her sensible proposal. ‘There is the
more need for me to hurry back, since Madge is
to call for me. I cannot make out how she did
not reach my place before I started.—Good-bye.’</p>

<p>The dame had been watching him anxiously
all the time; and now she laid her hand with
motherly tenderness on his arm.</p>

<p>‘Thou art poorly, Philip: come back here
to-night.’</p>

<p>‘I cannot promise that; but I will come as
soon as possible.... Do you think it likely
that Madge might have gone to see Mr Beecham?’
he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>‘What would she do that for?’ said Aunt
Hessy with some surprise.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know—but it seems, they have struck
up a great friendship.’ He spoke with affected
carelessness, his eye scanning the floor.</p>

<p>‘Then I must tell thee, she has gone to Mr
Shield, and will bring thee good news. Thou
must learn the rest from herself. It would
not be fair for me to take the pleasure from
her.’</p>

<p>What had she gone to Mr Shield for? and
what good news was she to bring him? Had
she suspected or discovered that he was on the
brink of ruin, and gone to plead for assistance?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">{533}</span>
That would be a sting indeed. Hard as it
might be for him to do it himself, it was
unbearable to think that she should be brought
to such a pass. This idea presented itself to
him in all sorts of shapes, as he hurried back
to Dunthorpe station, and it by no means tended
to allay his agitation.</p>

<p>He drove straight from Liverpool Street to
his chambers. They had been left in charge
of one of the office lads, sent from Golden Alley
for the purpose. This smart youth informed
him that no one had called and no message
had arrived during his absence.</p>

<p>He dismissed the lad and, with a dogged
determination to master his nervous excitement,
attacked the account-books and vouchers once
more. His head was painfully clear now, and
he was surprised at the sudden development of
a hitherto unsuspected capacity for figures. He
threaded the mazes of those long columns with
what was for him singular rapidity and accuracy.
He was rewarded by finding everything perfectly
correct: the balance, although largely against
him, was strictly in accordance with the items
entered; and for every item, there was the
voucher beside him.</p>

<p>He only paused when the fading light compelled
him to rise and light the lamp. There
was no mistake about it: the money had been
spent in accordance with his directions, and
there was no present return, nor any probability
of a return in the future. A black lookout,
truly; and he began to wonder gloomily whether
it would not be best to undergo that whitewashing
process of which Wrentham spoke so
admiringly. By that means he would at anyrate
save himself from the pain of losing more
money which did not belong to him.</p>

<p>He passed his hand slowly over his head and
stared vacantly, like one dazed by some mental
vision of horror. Had he then lost faith in the
work he had undertaken? Was he to bow down
and own that he had blundered egregiously in
imagining that there were men—and women
too—willing to work and capable of seeing the
advantages of being paid for what they produced—paid
for quality as well as quantity—rather
than by a fixed wage for so much time
spent on the premises of the employer? No; he
had not blundered: the system was in a minor
degree already in vogue in various trades, and
there was no reason why it should not be developed
to its full extent, so that the workman
should find that his labour was tangible capital,
which would increase as it improved in quality
and productiveness.</p>

<p>His eye fell on the open account-books on his
table. What a cruel commentary on his brave
speculations. He had tried to realise them—tried
under the most favourable circumstances of time
and money. The people were in a ferment of
discontent with their condition, ready, apparently,
to enter upon any scheme which promised to
improve it; and the capital he had invested in
his scheme for their benefit was considerable.
And he had failed!</p>

<p>Again the dogged look came into his face.
The failure was not due to the men or to the
scheme: the fault lay in himself. He had mismanaged
somehow; and he had not yet found
out how.</p>

<p>He was roused from his reverie by a sharp
knock at the door. It was Wrentham, who
entered briskly and with the air of one who
has important intelligence to communicate. His
manner was not precisely excited; but it was
flustered, as if he had been running a race and
was a little out of breath. ‘No message yet, old
man, I suppose?’</p>

<p>‘None,’ replied Philip, and his tone was not
indicative of a pleasant humour. ‘Has anything
happened—since I saw you?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, something has happened,’ was the answer.</p>

<p>Wrentham cooled suddenly when he observed
how Philip had been occupied. ‘Have you seen
Miss Heathcote?’</p>

<p>Philip had a repugnance to the sound of
Madge’s name on this man’s lips, and yet it was
pronounced respectfully enough.</p>

<p>‘I have not seen her yet.—But look here,
Wrentham; I wish you would do without referring
to Miss Heathcote so frequently. I do not
like to have her name mixed up in the mess of
my affairs.’</p>

<p>‘I beg your pardon, my dear Philip, if I have
touched the very least of your corns. ’Pon my
honour, it was accidental, and I am sorry for it.’</p>

<p>‘All right, all right.’</p>

<p>‘Well, but I must ask you to pardon me once
again, for I am compelled to refer to the lady,
and I hope to do so as a gentleman should in
speaking to his friend of the fair one who is to
be that friend’s wife. Will you grant me leave?’</p>

<p>‘What is it?’ was the irritable query.</p>

<p>‘I mentioned to you that I imagined Miss
Heathcote could throw some light on the proceedings
of Mr Beecham and Mr Shield. Now
I know she can.’</p>

<p>‘You say that as if you thought she would
not. How do you know that she knows anything
about their business?’</p>

<p>‘Don’t get into a temper with me—there’s a
good fellow. Although I could not enter into
your plan with the enthusiasm you and I would
have liked, I am anxious—as anxious as yourself—to
see you out of this scrape.’ (He had good
reasons of his own to be anxious; for there
was a certain strip of blue paper in the hands
of Philip’s bankers which it was imperative that
Wrentham should get possession of; and that
he could not do unless a round sum was paid
in to Philip’s account during the week.)</p>

<p>‘Don’t mind my ill-humour just now,’ muttered
Philip apologetically, in answer to his
manager’s appeal.</p>

<p>‘Certainly not,’ Wrentham went on, instantly
restored to his usual ease. ‘Well, I could not
rest in the office to-day, and having put everything
square until to-morrow, I went up to
Clarges Street.’</p>

<p>‘To call on Mr Shield again?’</p>

<p>‘No; but to examine apartments in the house
opposite to the one in which he is staying.
Whilst I was engaged in that way, I looked across
the road and saw, in the room opposite, Beecham,
Shield, and Miss Heathcote together.’</p>

<p>‘Well, you guessed that Beecham was a friend
of my uncle’s, and as she started this morning
to visit Mr Shield, there was nothing extraordinary
in seeing them together.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, you were aware of that! No; nothing
extraordinary at all in seeing them together; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">{534}</span>
it confirms my surmise that Miss Heathcote can
give us—you, I mean—information which may
be useful.’</p>

<p>They were interrupted by a gentle knock at
the door, and when Philip opened it, Madge
entered.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SANITARY_INSPECTION_OF_THE_PORT">SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE PORT
OF LONDON.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> move easily in the little beaten track of
our own concerns, and do not think of the care
that is taken of us. What snug citizen of us
all ever imagines danger to himself and the
community from such a source as the port of
London? Nevertheless, if the matter be given
a moment’s consideration, it must be allowed
that danger threatens there of a very real kind.
Our great port swarms all the year round with
vessels of every nationality. They come with
human and other freight from this country and
that, from ports maybe in which disease of one
sort or another was rife when they sailed; they
carry the germs of many a deadly malady in
cabin or in hold; disease often ripens on
the voyage amongst passengers or crew, and is
carried right up to the port itself; and the
vessels, on their arrival here, lie a day, a week,
a month in our docks. What, if any, precautions
are taken, and by whom, to prevent the
diseases that are thus borne so near to us, from
spreading through the port, and from the port
through the wide area of London itself? The
thing is worth looking into for a moment.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>There is no better known craft in all the
Port of London than the <i>Hygeia</i>. She is the
little steam-launch used by the medical officer
of the port when, accompanied by his inspector,
he goes up and down the river on his sanitary
rounds. The inspector inspects, and the medical
officer receives the report and gives instructions.
Through the kindness of the medical officer
(Dr Collingridge), I was enabled, a few days
ago, to accompany him on board his fast-going
and comely little craft. The purpose I had in
going will be better understood if I explain
first what are the functions of the port medical
officer. He acts under the corporation of London,
who for ten years or more have been the
sanitary authority for this vast and teeming
port. The custom-house has sanitary powers of
a kind, but they are little better than nominal.
The duty of discovering an infected ship rests
upon them, but having done that, their responsibility
is almost at an end. For example, every
vessel arriving at the port of London from a
foreign port is bound, on reaching the quarantine
ground at Gravesend, to signal, for the information
of the boarding officer. This officer at
once visits the vessel, and interrogates the master
as to the health of the crew and passengers.
If all questions be answered in a satisfactory
manner, the vessel is allowed ‘free pratique,’
and the quarantine certificate is issued, without
which no vessel is allowed to report. If there
has been any sickness of an infectious or contagious
character, the vessel is examined by the
Customs medical officer, who, if he find infectious
cases on board, communicates with the medical
officer of the ship-hospital at Greenwich. But
the arrangements in force at this moment for
preventing the importation of disease into the
port of London are exceedingly defective, insomuch
as—unless the disease be cholera, plague,
or yellow fever—there exists no power by which
an infected vessel can be detained at the entrance
to the port. Unless, therefore, the hospital
officer—who acts in concert with the port medical
officer—arrive immediately, a vessel containing
infectious disease is allowed to pass up the river
with her cases on board, and it is not until her
arrival in dock that the patients are able to be
removed by the medical officer of the port. But
this weak point in the system is now in train to be
wholly remedied, for the corporation have within
the last few weeks framed a regulation by which
no vessel with any contagious or infectious disease
on board will be allowed to pass into port until
the cases have been removed and the vessel thoroughly
cleansed and fumigated.</p>

<p>A notion may be gathered from the foregoing of
the functions of the port medical officer. He
derives his authority from the Port of London
Sanitary Committee of the corporation, a main
part of whose business it is to prevent the importation
of epidemics into London by means of the
vessels which arrive daily in the port from all
quarters of the globe. It is hardly necessary to
expatiate on the extreme importance of their functions;
but let me endeavour to show these by one
or two picked examples, and then—for the <i>Hygeia</i>
has her steam up, and the fog is rising rapidly—we
shall be off on our tour of inspection. In the
latter part of the summer of 1882, a very serious
epidemic of smallpox occurred at the Cape of
Good Hope. What has smallpox in South Africa
to do with us in London? A good deal, considering
that the shipping which arrives here from
that colony is enormous. The disease spread, the
death-rate rose, and our port medical officer was
very properly alarmed. He at once set to work
to take all due precautions, and by his orders,
rigid note was had of every vessel arriving from
the Cape. Beyond this, a circular letter was
addressed to the principal Companies and shipowners
engaged in that trade, calling attention
to the disease, and asking for immediate notice
in the event of its breaking out on board any
vessel. It turned out that very few vessels
carried the disease; but, thanks to the precautionary
measures that had been taken, such
cases as did arrive in the port were promptly
discovered and dealt with. At another time
Boulogne was attacked by the same disease,
and as this is a port within nine or ten hours’
voyage of London, and steamers arrive almost
daily, the matter was of great importance to the
port sanitary authorities of London. The medical
officer himself visited Boulogne, to inquire into
the causes and extent of the disease; and in
the port an inspector was told off to examine
each vessel on its arrival; while the General
Steam Navigation Company were advised to order
the revaccination of all officers and crews on
vessels running to Boulogne. The recent outbreak
of cholera in Egypt occasioned no small
anxiety to the Port Sanitary Committee, and it
was owing in part no doubt to the vigilance of
the medical officer and his assistants that not a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">{535}</span>
single case of the malady appeared in this port.
To the crew of every infected ship, or of any
ship arriving from an infected port, the medical
officer offers vaccination free of cost. These are
some amongst the precautions that are taken to
protect the citizens of London against the importation
of infectious diseases from foreign ports.
Not a vessel that enters the port of London,
great or small, or of any nationality, escapes
inspection. There are two inspectors for the
river, one of whom, in the <i>Hygeia</i>, and the other
in a rowing-boat, goes through and through the
port every day of the week; and two for the
docks, the whole of which—miles in extent—undergo
a careful daily inspection. I forget how
many thousands of vessels the medical officer told
me were overhauled in this way in the course of a
year—British, American, French, German, Dutch,
Danish, Austrian, Russian, Italian, Spanish,
Portuguese, Greek, Swedish, and Norwegian.
Cases of infection are received at present on the
hospital-ship at Greenwich; but a land-hospital
has just been opened there, an improvement
on the floating establishment for which the
medical officer has long been anxiously waiting.
A ship-hospital, he says, is useful enough for one
class of infectious disease; but he holds that it is
impossible effectually to isolate more than one
class in the same vessel; and in addition to this
grave disadvantage, there is the danger to the
vessel herself, an illustration of which was afforded
one rough night lately, when the hospital-ship
<i>Rhin</i> broke from her moorings and went pitching
down the river.</p>

<p>But let us see how the work of inspection is
done. We are aboard our pretty little launch,
which has been steaming impatiently this half-hour
past. The master is at the wheel, the ‘boy’
is lively with the ropes, and the inspector has
his note-book ready. The medical officer descends
to the cosy little cabin; and when he has changed
his silk hat for the regulation blue cloth cap,
and bestowed his umbrella where no nautical eye
may see it, he produces a cigar-case, and observes
casually, that should stress of weather confine us
below, the locker is not wholly destitute of
comforts. That all may know what we are and
what our business is, we fly in the bows, or the
stern—I speak as a landsman—a small blue
flag, whereon is inscribed in white letters, ‘Port
Medical Officer.’</p>

<p>We are not going to make the tour of the
whole port, which at our necessarily moderate
rate of speed—though the <i>Hygeia</i> can do her
twelve knots an hour and race any craft on the
river—would be something like a day’s voyage;
for the area over which the Port Sanitary Committee
has control is a wide one, embracing the
whole river from Teddington Lock to Gravesend,
and from below Gravesend to Trinity High
Water. We are to run through the region
known as the Pool, which, commencing below
London Bridge, ends somewhere about the West
India Docks. It is now half-past ten o’clock,
and the river is all astir with its own picturesque
and varied life. The rising breeze has scattered
the mist, and fretted the surface of the
water, which dances around us in a thousand
crested wavelets. The sun has struggled through
a mass of slate-coloured clouds, and plays over
the wonderful towers and steeples of the City
churches, and lights up the gray old wharfs
along the river, and pierces the deep holds of
vessels discharging their cargoes.</p>

<p>In making his ordinary round, the inspector
works steadily up or down the river, going from
vessel to vessel, until all have been examined.
But as I am anxious not only to see the routine
of inspection, but to get some notion besides of
the variety of the craft lying in the Pool, the
medical officer kindly proposes to make a selection
of typical vessels. Steering out of the course
of a fine Thames barge, just bearing down on us
with all sail set, and fit as she moves to be transferred
to the vivid canvas of Miss Clara Montalba,
we stop alongside a Dutch eel-boat. The inspector
has already intimated that the work of inspection
here will be little more than a form. He
never has any trouble with the Dutch eel-boats,
for the crew appear to spend the major part of
their existence in scrubbing, scouring, and polishing
their neat little craft. The skipper salutes
us in very passable English, and invites us aboard.
We go from stem to stern, above and below; and
I confess my inability to discover a single
speck of dirt. These are trim and sturdy
little boats, strongly and even handsomely
built, and able to stand a good deal of
weather. With a fair wind they make the
passage in one or two days, but are sometimes
delayed a fortnight or three weeks between
Holland and the Thames. We steer next for
one of the General Steam Navigation Company’s
continental steamships, with the blue boats hanging
in the davits. Here the inspector discovers
a small sanitary defect in the neighbourhood of
the forecastle, and a promise is given that it
shall be remedied without delay. I am much
struck by the genial and kindly style of the
inspector. He has the <i>suaviter in modo</i> in perfection.
It is never ‘Do this’ or ‘Look to that,’
but, ‘If I were you now, I think I’d,’ &amp;c.; which
goes far to account for the evident good feeling
with which he is everywhere received. He can
afford, however, to go about his business in a courteous
spirit, for he rests upon the strong arm of
the law. We board next a Thames sailing-barge.
These vessels carry a miscellaneous cargo of grain,
bricks, manure, cement, &amp;c., from below London
Bridge up the Medway. They are for the most
part handsome and well-kept ships. There is
no prettier sight on the river than a fleet of
Thames barges sailing into port on a sunny
summer’s day, laden high with hay or straw.
The inspector puts the usual questions; ‘How
many have you aboard? How’s the health of
the crew?’ and so on; and then we take a look
round. Both the medical officer and the inspector
have a keen eye to the water-casks, and to the
cabin where the crew have their bunks or hammocks.
The mate has the pick of the berths;
the men come next; and the ‘boy’ takes his
chance in a hole, where, if he be pretty well
fagged out by the time he turns in, he may not
impossibly manage to get his forty winks. In
the matter of crew, by the way, these Thames
barges are generally short-handed, and a bad
time they have of it in dirty weather, when all
hands are needed for the sails, and the helm and
everything else has to be abandoned. It is
small wonder that so many of them are lost.</p>

<p>Our next visit is to one of the splendid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">{536}</span>
Dundee passenger boats. No chance of fault-finding
here, where everything is spick-and-span
throughout. These are very fast boats, and
their fittings are fine enough for a yacht. The
chairs in the saloon are velvet, the fireplace a
picture in itself, and the pantry glistens with
silver-plate. As we go down below, the
captain suggests refreshments; but the medical
officer, fully alive to the force of example,
makes a modest reply to the effect that the
day is not yet far spent. We board then a
Guernsey sailing-boat, discharging a cargo of
granite. The mate is nursing a wounded hand,
crushed the day before in attending to a crank;
and the medical officer tenders a bit of professional
advice, for which he receives no fee.
The crew’s quarters in the forecastle have a
decidedly close smell, and the inspector thinks
that a little lime-washing would not be amiss.
We go on to visit a ‘monkey’-barge, the craft
which sails the unromantic waters of the canal.
Cleanliness abounds here—the master, in fact,
is polishing his candlestick when we arrive; but
he receives a reprimand from the inspector for
not having his papers on board. In this way
the work of inspection is performed. It is
lightly and easily done, to such perfection has
the system been brought; and thanks to the
extreme care with which it has been carried out
for years past, and to the readiness with which
masters and owners have complied with the
instructions of the medical officer, it is now
often in nine cases out of ten almost entirely
formal. To see the really big vessels, we must
go farther down the river; but we have learned
something in the Pool as to the manner in
which the sanitary work is conducted amongst
the craft of every description.</p>

<p>We are now at the Shadwell entrance to the
London Docks. Limehouse is on one side of us,
and Rotherhithe on the other. It is a charming
bit of the river, for those with an eye for quaint
water-side scenery, as one of Mr Whistler’s
early canvases abundantly testifies. The gray
steeple of Limehouse church is to the left;
nearer to hand, the red house of the harbour-master
stands out brightly; ancient weather-smitten
wharfs are on either side; queer old
tenements with projecting stories, and coloured
white, brown, and black, elbow one another
almost into the water; and behind us rise the
countless masts and delicate rigging of the
vessels lying in the dock. The sun has gained
full power now, and burnishes the restless surface
of the river as I take leave of my courteous
friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A little</span> knot of miners were gathered round
the fire in Pat Murphy’s drinking-saloon, situated
in that delightful locality known to diggers as
Rattlesnake Gulch. They were listening eagerly
to the details of a story related by Gentleman
Jack, a member of their fraternity who had
recently visited San Francisco. He had gone
there with the twofold object of having what was
facetiously termed a ‘fling,’ just to relieve the
monotony of existence, and also with the intention
of exchanging the gold he had accumulated
during the past six months for notes and coin.
He had likewise in some mysterious way contrived
to get rid of the burden of his wealth,
and now returned almost penniless to the

diminished the cheerfulness with which the
wanderer greeted his mates, or disturbed the

<p>‘Spin out that yarn again, mate!’ demanded
a gentleman who rejoiced in the sobriquet of
Old Grizzly. This personage had only entered
the ‘bar’ in time to catch the concluding words
of the narrative. ‘Let’s have it, Jack!’ he
repeated impatiently.</p>

<p>Thus invited or encouraged, the young man
rejoined carelessly: ‘It was nothing much, only
the finding of a man—all that was left of him
at least—in a place they call the Devil’s Panniken,
when they were blasting the rock for the new
railroad between Sandy Bar and ’Frisco’——</p>

<p>‘I know the place—travelled that road years
afore they ever thought of running cars through
it,’ interposed Old Grizzly. ‘But what about
the man?’</p>

<p>‘Well, that’s the queer part of the story;
not that they found a man, but that they should
have found him where they did, and with so
much gold on him too,’ answered Gentleman
Jack with his slow languid drawl.</p>

<p>‘Say!’ ejaculated Old Grizzly, who was listening
with a curiously eager excited face to the
indifferent, careless utterances of the younger
man. ‘Cut it short, mate, and tell us how
they found him.’</p>

<p>‘Well, they were blasting a big rock, and as
it broke, it disclosed a cave right in the heart
of the limestone; but there must once have
been an entrance to it, for the skeleton of a
man lay there. All his clothes had fallen to
dust; but there was a ring on one finger, and
about seventeen ounces of gold lay in a little
heap under him. It had evidently been in his
pockets once; but the bag that held it, and the
skeleton’s clothing, were alike a heap of dry
light dust. There was nothing to identify him,
nothing to show how long he had been there.
The very ring he wore was of such a queer
outlandish fashion that the fellows who found
him could make nothing of it.’</p>

<p>‘Was that all?’ demanded the elder man.</p>

<p>‘All that I can recollect.—Stay! I think he
had a rusty knife somewhere near him, but
nothing more. It’s a queer story altogether.
How he got there, if he died in the cave, and
by what means it was afterwards closed up—these
are all mysteries.’</p>

<p>Old Grizzly smoked in silence for some time;
and the miners had resumed the usual occupations
of their idle hours, drinking, smoking,
playing poker, and quarrelling, which amiable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">{537}</span>
amusements had been momentarily suspended
in order to welcome the return of the ‘Wanderer’
with due <i>empressement</i>, when suddenly the deep
voice of Old Grizzly was heard above the babel
of tongues, saying: ‘This story of Jack’s about
the Devil’s Panniken and the man they found
there puts me in mind of what befell me and
a mate of mine when we were riding through
that same place one October night hard upon
twenty years ago. His Satanic Majesty had a
hand in that job, if ever he had in anything.’</p>

<p>‘Spin us your yarn, old chap!’ shouted a dozen
voices; and passing the word for a fresh supply
of whisky, they gathered closer round the log-fire,
filled their pipes, and prepared to listen
with the keen interest of men who lead an
isolated and monotonous life far from the stir
and life of big cities, and are therefore ever
ready and eager to hail the smallest incident
with pleasure; while a good story-teller is
regarded with universal respect. Rattlesnake
Gulch was at that period a comparatively new
Claim, on the very outskirts of civilisation, and
news from the cities was long in reaching the
denizens of this locality.</p>

<p>‘What I am now going to tell you, boys, has
never crossed my lips from that day to this, and
most likely never would, if I hadn’t chanced to
come along just now as Jack was speaking about
the body those navvies found in the Devil’s
Panniken.’</p>

<p>Being politely requested by his hearers to
‘Shell it out!’ Old Grizzly continued: ‘Whether
you believe what I’m going to say is no matter
now. <i>I</i> believe it, though I can’t understand
how it all came about. Well, as I said before,
the time was hard on twenty years ago, and the
night was the last in October.’</p>

<p>‘Bedad, and it’s that same night now!’ put
in Murphy.</p>

<p>‘So it is!’ acquiesced Old Grizzly; ‘but I
never thought of it till this minute; and now
the whole thing comes round again on All-Halloween,
of all nights in the year. Those of
you boys who’ve been raised in the old country
will know what folks believe, in most villages
and country places, of Halloween, and the strange
things that happen then to men abroad at midnight,
and to lads and lasses who try the
Halloween spells for wives and husbands.’</p>

<p>‘Sure everybody knows them things,’ agreed
Murphy, casting an uneasy glance over his
shoulder as he spoke.</p>

<p>‘Well, true or false, I for one thought little
enough of them when I was young; but as luck
or fate would have it, I rode through the Devil’s
Panniken on the 31st of October, that special
night I’m going to tell you of. I wasn’t alone
either; perhaps, if I had been, I shouldn’t have
felt so jolly; for, not to speak of the loneliness
of the place, with its great black rocks towering
up on either side of you, and almost shutting
out the sky, except for a narrow strip overhead,
the place had an ill name both with the Injuns
and with miners. Many a queer tale was told
round camp-fires, and folks said the place was
haunted; that miners had lost their way there
many a time, and had never been seen or heard
of again.</p>

<p>‘I’d been working all that season at a Claim—a
new un then, but worked out and forgotten
now—which we used to call Cherokee Dick’s,
because a Cherokee Injun first showed us the
place. There was perhaps a dozen of us all
told; but I chummed and worked from the first
along with a chap they called the “Flying Dutchman.”
When we had been together a goodish
bit, he told me his real name was Cornelius
Vermudyn; and I acquainted him with mine and
where I hailed from. He was a Dutchman, sure
enough, but had travelled half over the world, I
used to think from his talk; and he could speak
as good English as you or me—or any here.’</p>

<p>A dubious smile hovered for an instant on
Gentleman Jack’s lips at this naïve statement,
but nobody observed him; they were all intent
on Old Grizzly and his yarn, and that worthy
continued: ‘We began to find our Claim about
cleaned out, and we—that’s me and Vermudyn—reckoned
to make tracks before the winter, and
get down ’Frisco-way. Well, we each had a
good horse and a nice bit of gold, and we was
sworn mates—come what might—so we started,
riding as far as we could by day and camping
out at night, if we weren’t able to reach a settlement
or diggings by nightfall.</p>

<p>‘On this night, it seemed as if we’d no luck
from the beginning. We lost our way for a
goodish bit, and were some time finding the track
again; after that, night seemed to come on us
suddenly like. We’d rode and rode that day
without ever a sign of man or beast, and when
we came to this place, Vermudyn says: “This
must be the famous Devil’s Panniken, old boy.”
I had been almost falling asleep on my horse’s
neck; but I woke with a start, and answered all
in a hurry: “Of course it is.” It seemed somehow
as if I knew that place well, and I began
to ride on quickly.</p>

<p>“Stop!” hollered Vermudyn, “unless you
want to lame your horse or break his knees
among those rocks.” As he came up with me,
he put his hand on my arm, and I drew rein.</p>

<p>“Anyhow,” I said, “let’s get out of this, and
then we’ll camp for the night. I’m as tired as
a dog, and can hardly stick in my saddle.”</p>

<p>“Why not camp here?” says Vermudyn with
a laugh. “Who’s afraid?”</p>

<p>“I’m not—if that’s what you mean,” I
answered; “but I’d rather camp outside.”</p>

<p>“A good two miles of bad riding,” said he
quietly. “Why shouldn’t we content ourselves
with a snug corner of the rocks, where we can
shelter from the wind? As far as I can make
out, there’s brush and litter enough for a fire,
and we’ve got a bait for our horses.”</p>

<p>‘While he talked and argued, I grew more
and more tired, exactly as if I had ridden a
hundred miles without drawing rein. It seemed
then as if I didn’t care what came next, so long
as I could roll myself up in my blanket and
snooze, so I answered short enough: “Have
your own way. The place is ours, I reckon, as
much as it is other folk’s.”</p>

<p>“The pixies and demons, you mean,” laughed
Vermudyn. “I know all the miners’ tales!
Never fear. I dare wager we shall see nothing
worse than ourselves, if we stop for a month of
Sundays.—Did you ever hear,” he went on, “of
the White Witch of the Panniken? She should
meet us hereabouts, if all tales be true. She
waits for lonely travellers, and shows them gold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">{538}</span>
in the rock where gold never was in daylight;
and if a man is tempted, for the gold’s sake or
hers, to spend the night with her, he’s never
seen or heard of in this world again. She feasts
him with the sight of big nuggets and her own
beauty, while she sucks his heart’s blood like
the vampyre; and when his body is drained to
the last drop, he is flung aside among the rocks
or dropped in some dark gully; and she comes
back to watch the road for a fresh prey.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of the White Witch many a time;
but I never knew the rights of the story until
to-night,” said I. “But witch or no witch, we’ll
have to stop; the road grows harder, and my
horse seems to stumble at every step. It’s so
dark, too, I can hardly see my hand before my
face; yet it seemed almost daylight when we
rode into the gorge.”</p>

<p>“The pair of us will be too many for the White
Witch, anyhow,” said Vermudyn. “Too much
human society don’t agree with her ghostly constitution.”</p>

<p>‘We had stopped together, and I was just
going to get off my horse, when Vermudyn sang
out in a hurry: “I see a light!—there to the
left. Let’s ride up. We may find a party forced
to camp out like ourselves; or they may be
Injuns; and any company is better than none
to-night.”</p>

<p>“Right enough,” says I, rubbing my eyes.
“There is a light, and a pretty strong one too;
a steady light, mate, and not a Will-o’-the-wisp.
I never heard before of white man or Injun
daring to camp in the Devil’s Panniken.”</p>

<p>“Well, we must go up quietly till we can see
our company,” said my mate. “We don’t want
to drop on a gang of freebooters, who’ll ease us
of the dust, and then leave us with a bullet
through our heads, as a parting gift.”</p>

<p>‘After this, we rode forward in silence for
what seemed a quarter of a mile; but we went
at a foot’s pace, on account of picking our way
among the rocks that lay thick in the road.
Then, as we turned a sharp corner, we saw all
at once that the light came not from a camp-fire,
but from a house!</p>

<p>“Well,” says I, “in all the years I’ve worked
in these parts, man and boy, and tramped from
claim to claim, I’ve never heard that there was
hut or shanty in this place.”</p>

<p>“Nor I neither,” returns Vermudyn; “but
perhaps it’s a new spec; though what folks could
want with a house where there’s neither gold to
find nor land to farm is more than I can tell.
We may thank our luck we’ve tumbled across
it.”</p>

<p>‘He jumped off his horse as we drew rein at
the door of the queerest old house I ever saw.
It was a tumble-down sort of a place, half-stone,
half-wood; and the woodwork was fast
going to decay, though we could see plainly
enough that time and money had once been
spent over it. The stone was pretty rough;
but the house was all pointed gable-ends and
queer-shaped long windows. The high-peaked
overhanging roof and the diamond panes
reminded me of houses I’d seen in England
when I was a young un. The pointed gables
were faced with carved oak; and heavy oaken
beams, black with age, formed the framework
of the upper stories; while the spaces between
were roughcast with shingle and plaster. The
wickedest old faces were grinning and leering at
us from the carvings above the windows; and
we could see the whole place, every stick and
stone about it, as plain as daylight. We had
been riding in darkness through the Devil’s
Panniken, a darkness that grew blacker as we
went on; and the light from this house fairly
dazed us at first. Every window flamed as
though there were jolly fires in each room, and
hundreds of candles. The place seemed all aflame
inside and out; the walls were as bright as if
the moon was shining her clearest and strongest
full on the house; yet,’ said Old Grizzly, dropping
his voice impressively, ‘there was no moon
at all that night! We stopped and looked at
one another in wonder, and then stared at the
house again. We could hear sounds inside now
quite plain, men’s voices, and women’s too. Ugly
sounds besides, that I couldn’t understand; such
howling and shrieking as though all Bedlam
were let loose inside—wailing like some creature
in pain, and roars of mocking laughter. I turned
deadly cold, and shivered as if it were midwinter.</p>

<p>“For mercy’s sake, let’s get away from this
madhouse—if it’s not something worse!” said I.
“All’s not right here; and I’d go afoot all
night before I’d rest in that place.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” returned Vermudyn in his impetuous
way. “I’m going in, anyhow; and you’ll
stop to see fair-play, I know.”</p>

<p>‘The upshot of it was he seized my arm and
led me into the house; while a gipsy-looking
fellow came out for our horses, after we’d unloaded
our knapsacks and blankets. My gold
was sewed in a belt round my body, and I
determined to fight hard for dear life, if need
be; whilst I was equally determined to see
Vermudyn through the night’s adventure, as far
as it lay in my power.</p>

<p>‘If the outside of the house was strange to
us, the inside was still stranger. The furniture
appeared to be hundreds of years old. The
presses, chairs, and tables were all of polished
black oak, which reflected the light of many
candles; while a big fire roared in the open
fireplace, near which a table was laid for supper,
and everything on it matched all we’d already
seen. There were drinking-horns mounted in
silver; cups of the same; such a load of plate
as I’d never seen in my life, and such as, I
was pretty certain, belonged to no country inn
in a wild district where the only travellers were
miners, and the only natives Injuns. On the
top of a carved press in one corner there was
a fine show of bottles—long-necked, slender flasks,
crusted over with age and cobwebs; and short
squat bottles, that held hollands and Kirschwasser,
Vermudyn told me.</p>

<p>‘Well, while we took stock of the room and its
contents, there wasn’t a soul to be seen, yet the
noise and hubbub continued still all around us;
the clatter of a hundred voices rising and falling
far and near like the wind. Laughter, screams,
and low moans all together, or following each
other quickly. The longer I listened, the less
I liked it; yet, as I sat in a corner of the
big chimney, I seemed to grow drowsy and stupid-like,
as if I had no power of my limbs or my
voice. I think I couldn’t have walked a dozen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">{539}</span>
steps for a thousand pounds; yet I could still
hear and see all, through a light mist that fell
betwixt me and everything I looked at.</p>

<p>‘Vermudyn didn’t appear afraid or surprised
in the least; and the spell—I can call it nothing
else—that was over me had no effect on him.
He stood in front of the fire, warming his
hands, and looking round him quite gaily, and
pleased with all he saw.</p>

<p>“Wake up, mate!” he called to me; “we’ve
fallen in luck’s way this time, surely. You’ve
no cause to fear. It seems to me that I must
have been here a score of times before, I know
the place so well; and yet”—he stopped for a
minute and put his hand over his eyes—“and
yet—it can’t be!—I know it. That press,”
he went on, “should hold the green suit.”
And stepping across the room, he opened a
worm-eaten cupboard in the far corner, and took
out a suit of faded green velvet, the cut of
which reminded me of old pictures I’d seen
at home; and when Vermudyn took them out
and looked them over carefully, the whole thing
struck me so absurdly, that I began to laugh
like a maniac, though still I had no power to
speak. I wanted to tell him he would look
like a tumbling mountebank at a fair, if he
rigged himself out in the velvet suit; but I
only laughed and nodded at him silently from
the chimney corner, like some drivelling old
dotard.</p>

<p>‘However, he didn’t put it on, but, as if
struck suddenly by another thought, threw it
aside, and opened a cupboard near the fireplace.
He smiled again. “I knew it was here,” he
said softly, as he returned to the fire, and stooping
down, held something to the light. It was
a little box of carved ivory, yellow with age,
and strangely shaped; but Vermudyn seemed
as familiar with it as he was with the rest of
the wonders in that house, for he pressed a
spring, and the lid flew up, disclosing a sparkling
chain made like a snake, with shining
scales of beaten gold that glittered in the flickering
firelight.</p>

<p>‘While Vermudyn was still looking at its
twisted coils and muttering to himself, the door
opened, and a troop of figures crowded into the
room.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IS_THE_SEASHORE_FREE_TO_ALL">IS THE SEASHORE FREE TO ALL?</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">To</span> the ordinary visitor to the seacoast this question
may seem unnecessary. To him it probably
appears, if he ever gives the matter a thought,
that the shore is free and open to everybody; and
that no one person really has any more rights over
it than another. If he were told that he was no
more entitled to walk or be driven across the
beach for the purpose of obtaining his morning
dip in the sea than he was to cross the park of a
private gentleman and bathe in his lake without
permission, he would probably refuse all credence
to the statement. If he were further told that
when he picked up a shell off the sands and
walked away with it, he was guilty of an unlawful
act, his mental attitude would most likely be one
of indignation, and in most cases his belief in his
own indisputable right to be where he was, and to
enjoy himself as seemed best to him, provided
that he did not interfere with the comfort of his
neighbours, would be in no way shaken.</p>

<p>It is the object of what follows to show how
little ground there is for this belief. To begin
with, a brief definition of the shore will be useful.
Strictly speaking, it is that portion of the land
adjacent to the sea which is alternately covered
and uncovered by the ordinary flow and ebb of
the tides. The fringe of rock, sand, or shingle,
which is to be found on most parts of the English
coast, and which is never under water except at
the highest spring-tides, does not form a part of
the ‘shore,’ though it is commonly spoken of as
such; and the law only recognises as shore that
portion of the coast which lies between the
ordinary high and low water marks. All that
portion of it which lies nearer to the land than
the ordinary high-water mark is part of the <i>terra
firma</i>, and, as such, is subject to the usual rights
of ownership. This technical ‘shore’ throughout
the coasts of England belongs, except as is
mentioned afterwards, to the Crown. As is well
known, the theory of the law is that the whole
soil of England belonged originally to the
sovereign, by whom it has, in process of time,
been almost entirely granted to subjects. Some
of our sovereigns have also occasionally exercised
their rights of ownership in the seashore by
making grants of it, in company with the adjoining
<i>terra firma</i>; so that there are cases in which
the shore, as well as the adjacent <i>terra firma</i>, is
subject to private ownership.</p>

<p>So much by way of definition and explanation.
Let us now briefly consider what rights the
ordinary subject has to the use and enjoyment of
the seashore. We will begin by considering his
right to use it as a means of access to the sea for
the purpose of bathing. The first time this
question was raised in a court of justice in
England was in the case of Blundell against
Caterall, which was tried in the year 1821. If
the reader will look at a map of England, he will
find marked on the coast of Lancashire, a few
miles north of Liverpool, the town of Great
Crosby. In the year 1815 an hotel was built
there. Before that time, people who lived at
Great Crosby had bathed on the beach, but they
had done so in a simple and primitive manner;
they undressed themselves in some convenient
spot, and then walked over the sands into the
sea. When the hotel was built, the proprietor
thought that it would be for the comfort of his
guests and his own profit if a more convenient
means of bathing were provided; and
so he had built a number of ‘machines’ of
the well-known type. Caterall was one of the
hotel proprietor’s servants, and was employed by
him to drive these machines into the sea. The
plaintiff, Mr Blundell, was lord of the manor of
Great Crosby, and he claimed that the shore
there had been specially granted to him, and
formed part of his manor. This grant of the
shore was not proved, but it was not questioned
by the counsel who appeared for Caterall, and
so was taken for granted. The contention of
Caterall’s counsel was what would probably be
in accordance with the views of most people
on the subject. He argued that there was a
common-law right for all the king’s subjects
to bathe on the seashore, and to pass over it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">{540}</span>
for that purpose on foot or with horses and
carriages.</p>

<p>The case was fully discussed and long judgments
were delivered by the four judges before
whom it was tried. The result was that it
was decided by three judges against one that
no such general right in the subject to frequent
the shore for the purpose of bathing existed,
whether on foot or in carriages. The dissenting
judge, who seems to have taken a broad and
common-sense view of the matter, based his
judgment on the general grounds of the sea
being the great highway of the world; of the
importance of a free access to it; and of the
necessity of a right to bathe in it, as essential to
the health of so many persons. ‘It was clear,’
he said, ‘that persons had bathed in the sea
from the earliest times, and that they had been
accustomed to walk or ride on the sands....
The shore of the sea is admitted to have been
at one time the property of the king, and from
the general nature of the property, it could never
be used for exclusive occupation. It was holden
by the king, like the sea and highways, for all
his subjects.’ Unfortunately for the subjects,
however, the other three judges, and consequently
the majority of the court, were convinced by the
arguments of the counsel who opposed the claim
to the right of bathing. This opposition was
based on three grounds. ‘First,’ said Mr Blundell’s
counsel, ‘there is no evidence to be found in any
of the legal authorities for the existence of any
such right; they are completely silent upon the
matter. Secondly, such a right is contrary to
analogies. Thirdly, such a right is contrary to
acknowledged and established rights.’</p>

<p>The first and third of these arguments seem to
have chiefly influenced the judges in coming to
their decision. This decision, which must be
taken as ruling the matter, up to the present
time at anyrate, declares, as has been stated, that
the subject has no right to pass over the shore
for the purpose of bathing. The actual right to
bathe in the sea does not seem to have been
disputed; what was settled was, that a man
has no right to pass over the shore in order to
reach the sea. If any one chooses to take ship
from Ireland to within a few yards of the
Lancashire coast, and then bathe from the deck,
there is nothing in the decision in the case of
Blundell against Caterall to show that he would
in any way be going beyond his strict legal
rights. Such a course would, however, be inconvenient—and
decidedly expensive.</p>

<p>Of course, when the shore remains undisputedly
in the possession of the Crown, no interference
with the subject’s privilege of bathing, under
fitting conditions, is to be apprehended. The
decision in Blundell <i>v.</i> Caterall, however, shows
that where a portion of the shore has been made
the subject of a grant, there is nothing to hinder
the person in whose favour the grant has been
made from entirely preventing it from being
used for the purpose of bathing, or from allowing
it to be so used only on payment of any
tax he may choose to demand. It is scarcely
necessary to say that no such claim on the part
of a private subject to such property in the
shore, carrying with it, as it does, the right to tax,
or even prevent altogether, sea-bathing, should be
allowed without the strictest possible examination
of it. Whether a man is possessed of the shore
will entirely depend upon the exact words used
to describe the boundaries of the land granted
to him. If the deed of grant describes the land
to be granted ‘down to the sea,’ or if any
similar words be used, such grant would not
include the shore; for it, as we have said, is what
lies between high-water and low-water marks;
and ‘down to the sea’ would be taken to mean
down to the ordinary high-water mark, and so
would just fall short of the ‘shore.’ If, on the
other hand, it should be distinctly stated that
the land is granted down to low-water mark, or
to any definite distance out to sea, which would
include the low-water mark, then undoubtedly the
shore, with its attached rights, has been granted.
Because it has been held judicially that the subject
has no right to use the shore as a means
of access to the sea for the purpose of bathing,
it must not, however, be inferred that he has
no right to be there at all. From time immemorial
it has been recognised that the ownership
by the Crown of the sea-shore is limited by a
common-law right on the part of the subject
to pass over it to reach the sea, for the purposes
of fishing and navigation; and as the Crown
cannot transfer to other persons more than it
possesses itself, these rights of the general public
still exist when the shore has passed into private
hands.</p>

<p>The right of bathing is not the only right
which most people are apt to take for granted
which has been disputed, and disputed successfully,
in the courts. How many people know
that when they pick up a shell or a piece of seaweed
and take it home with them, they are
rendering themselves liable to an action? Yet
it is so, as what follows will show. In the year
1801, one Bagott was the owner of a certain
manor in the parish of Keysham, and this manor
included—or at anyrate, Bagott claimed that it
did, and his claim was not disputed—a portion
of the seashore. In cases such as those here
cited, there seems to have been far too great
readiness to admit claims to the shore. It
appears that on this part of the coast shellfish
were found in great numbers, and it was the
custom of the people in the neighbourhood
to take them for the purpose of selling them,
or using them as food. Amongst those who
did so was a man called Orr. He employed
other men to help him, and took away great
quantities of the shellfish in carts, and seems,
by the magnitude of his operations, to have
exhausted Bagott’s patience. At anyrate, Bagott
commenced an action against him, alleging that
he (Orr) had entered certain closes of his (Bagott’s)
‘lying between the flux and reflux of the tides
of the sea, in the plaintiff’s manor of Keysham,
and the said shellfish and fish-shells there found,
caught, took, and carried away, and converted,
and disposed thereof, when the said closes were
left dry and were not covered with water.’ To
this Orr urged in defence, that what the plaintiff
called his closes were, as a matter of fact, rocks
and sand of the sea, lying within the flux and
reflux of the tides of the sea, and that the shellfish
and fish-shells which he had taken away
were ‘certain shellfish and fish-shells which were
in and upon the said rocks and sands of the sea,
and which were, by the ebbing of the tides of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">{541}</span>
sea, left there in and upon the said closes; and
that every subject of this realm of right had the
liberty and privilege of getting, taking, and carrying
away the shellfish and fish-shells left by the
said ebbing of the sea.’ The judgment of the
court, as it appears in the Report of the trial,
gives none of the reasons upon which it was
founded, but merely declares in the baldest
manner possible that the defendant had a right
to take the <i>shellfish</i>; but that, as no authority
had been brought forward to support his claim
to take <i>shells</i>, the court would pause before establishing
a general right of that kind!</p>

<p>Of course, this judgment cannot be taken
quite literally, for the shellfish cannot be taken
unless their shells are taken also. What it
must be understood to lay down is this, that
we may take the shells so long as they are
attached to, and form, as it were, part of the
living fish; but that we must not take a shell
when it has become detached from its inmate, and
is nothing more than a shell. This prohibition
to take empty shells is really equivalent to a
prohibition to take not shells only, but also
sand or pebbles, or indeed any other part of the
soil of the shore. It may be added here, by way
of parenthesis, that, by an Act of Parliament
passed in 1620, a special privilege is granted
to all persons living in the counties of Devon
and Cornwall ‘to fetch and take sea-sand at
all places under the full sea-mark.’ Why this
privilege was specially granted to the inhabitants
of these two counties is not at all clear.
At anyrate, the passing of the Act shows that
the right did not previously exist.</p>

<p>The last case to which we shall refer is that
of Howe against Stowell. It was tried in the
year 1833. Here, as in the case of Bagott against
Orr, the plaintiff was the owner of a portion of
the shore, upon which, at different times, the sea
cast up great quantities of seaweed. The farmers
in the neighbourhood were in the habit of carting
this seaweed away, using it for the purpose of
manuring their land. Stowell had taken some,
and Howe brought an action against him. Stowell
urged that, as a subject of the king, he had full
and perfect liberty to go upon the shore and take
the seaweed, which had been left there by the
reflux of the tide. The court, however, found
that no such right as Stowell claimed existed.
Their judgment to some extent supplements and
explains the one delivered in the case of Bagott
<i>v.</i> Orr. The court referred to that case, and said
that the taking of fish was for the immediate
sustentation of man—a reason which did not
apply to the taking of seaweed. Whatever the
reasons may have been which caused the court
to make a distinction between the fish and their
shells, the distinction certainly now exists; and
while it is unlawful to take away from the shore
any shells, sand, pebbles, or seaweed, it is perfectly
lawful to carry away any shellfish that may
be found there.</p>

<p>Here we may leave the subject. Sufficient has
been said to show the reader how much of the
liberty of doing what he likes on the seashore
is entirely due to the goodwill of such as have
the power, if they choose to use it, of very seriously
curtailing that liberty. Happily, by far the
greater portion of our shore is still the property
of the Crown, which is never likely to enforce
its strict rights to the curtailing of the reasonable
liberty of the subject. These rights might, however,
with general advantage, be much more
strictly enforced than they are on some parts of
our coasts, where sand, pebbles, and stones are
being constantly carted away in large quantities,
to the detriment of the beach and adjacent
land.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> a leisure hour to spend now and then,
and I spend it in rambling round the city
where I dwell. Perhaps some of you may think
this is poor enjoyment, but it does not seem so
to me. True, were I young and rich, I might
seek my pleasures farther afield—on the sunny
shores of the Mediterranean, or in the gay
gardens of France. I might bask more in the
smile of gentle dames, forgetting my loneliness,
as one forgets in the sunshine that only a
moment before the sky hung black with clouds.
But I am neither young nor rich; and even
if I were, it seems to me that no place in
the world could ever be so dear as those lanes
and meadows I love so well.</p>

<p>Yes; I am old now, and chilly sometimes at
night when the fire gets low, wearing a greatcoat
even on the summer days, and shivering often
when the zephyrs fan my face. But I am kept
young by my love for nature; I woo her as
amorously as ever maid was wooed by swain,
and she is not afraid to press her rosy lips
to mine, yellow and withered as they are, and
to twine her lovely arms round my neck. I
love her for her hopefulness, for her inexhaustible
store of youth. Everywhere with love she
rebukes poor mortals for sitting down sad with
folded hands, and with a glad voice bids them
be up and doing. She is irrepressible. You
may crush her down with stony hand and
plaster over every vestige of her beauty, and
then say to yourself, in pride of heart, ‘I have
made a city, a place for commerce and traffic,
and pleasure and sorrow;’ and yet, turn your
back for an instant, lo! a little blade of grass
comes up between the stones of the causeway
and laughs in your very face. We may
build our houses up story upon story, with
the dingy attic at the top, for women’s hearts
to break in, and the squalid court beneath
in which little children may get their first
taint of sin; but a gleam of sunshine will day
after day work its way down to the very
centre of the filth and squalidness, and a rose
will bud and bloom in some poor man’s window,
blushing back with pleasure into the face of
its kindly keeper.</p>

<p>Then think how charitable she is, how slow
to return an insult, how cheerfully she bears
an affront. I often think—though, of course,
it is but the vagary of an old dreamer—that
those who build up masses of brick and mortar
would be well repaid if nature left a sterile
belt round their work, a belt gray and cold
as their own walls. But no! She takes no
such revenge as this. Long before the city-smoke
has mingled with the clouds, or the hum
of city-life died away, we come on patches of
green, smiling us a welcome; on trees, too, sprouting
forth in beauty, or draped with leaves and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">{542}</span>
flowers, nodding to us in a grave and stately
way, as if to show that they at least bear no
grudge, and are prepared to be friendly in
spite of all rebuffs. Ruminating thus, many a
lesson have I learned on charity and forgiveness.</p>

<p>Nor are my rambles unromantic, though the
scenes are no longer strange. Every house and
farm has become familiar to me. I have seen
a generation or two of cowboys develop into
ploughmen, wed themselves to rosy dairymaids,
and go their ways. I have beguiled idle hours
in weaving webs of fancy round their married
lives, listening for the merry laughter of children
in their cottages, and watching for the
glad light of love on many a mother’s face.
And as with men and women, so with things.
The old castle with its turreted walls and
secret passages has furnished me much food
for thought. I have recalled in fancy the
noble men and fair women who used to tread
its halls, their courtly, gallant ways, their feasts
and tournaments; and, as I stand in the chambers,
girt with gray stone and canopied by heaven,
I can see the coats of mail still on the walls,
and hear through the mist of years the voice
of some gay warrior recounting his triumphs
in the field. And many a story, too, have
I heard from the rustic people about the old
gray house which stands in the hollow among
the trees. You see, I am old enough to pat
the comely maidens on the shoulder without
exciting the ire of their brawny lovers, and to
chat, too, with impunity to the buxom matrons
in the cottages while their husbands sit smoking
by the fireside. And thus it was I heard the
story of the Old House in the Hollow. I had
often wondered if it did contain a secret, so
silent was it, so forbidding in aspect, with
its old porch black with age, and its windows
stained and weather-beaten. It looked so
grim, that I used to think it, too, must have
witnessed deeds of blood, and taken the best
way to avoid detection by standing for evermore
in gloomy silence. It stood among thick
foliage, so thick, that even on a summer day
but a stray sunbeam or two rested on its
blackened walls, wavering and timorous, as if
scared at their bravery in venturing so far.
The carriage-road from the gate to the door
had faded out of sight, and there was nothing
around but grass, heavy and dark-coloured, with
the weeds that grew among it. The woman
in the cottage not far off was glad enough to
give me the key of the rusty iron gate which
admitted to the grounds, and there I used
to wander, more from curiosity than pleasure.
But I always felt morbid under the old trees;
and the grass, too, was so thick and rank, that
it was like walking over deserted graves.</p>

<p>In that old garden, said the villagers, a lady
in a white mantle used to walk among the trees,
and look with yearning glance towards the
windows of the old house. There I have waited
for her, but she never came; for, through habit,
I have fallen into believing the stories I hear.
Perhaps the sunshine frightened her away; perhaps,
from long living in the shades, her eyes
had grown too weak to bear the light; perhaps
she cared not that strangers should share her
grief, and wished to mourn there alone, with the
darkness for her friend, and the winds sighing
comfort to her among the trees. Whatever the
reason was, I never met her face to face in that
gloomy hollow. Yet, although she was so fair
and young, the older villagers could not tell her
tale without a shudder; and though the lads
and lasses laughed aloud, yet it was a wavering,
uncertain laugh, which died on their lips, and
left a silence all the more profound.</p>

<p>Forty years had passed since the oaken door
creaked on its hinges to admit the master and
his fair young bride; and a year later, it had
closed on her as they bore her away to sleep in
the churchyard, to the grave that had proved
too small for her wandering, restless spirit. On
that day, cold, and with a drizzling, chilling rain,
the small cortège passed through the gate, a man
walking behind, with head bent and eyes cast
on the ground, his face calm, but chill and gray
as the sky. And if the curious one had turned
his eyes on the house, he would have seen, at
an upper window, a woman’s figure, clad in
mourning, with head bent, intently watching
the pallbearers as they wound along the muddy
road. Had the curious one cared to look closer,
he might have seen the gleam of triumph in
her eyes—dark, flashing, coal-black eyes—as she
watched the tall bent figure walk behind with
such a weary, listless step. But soon a turn in
the road hid the company from view, and the
window was empty again.</p>

<p>One year had sufficed to darken the brightness
of that fair young life. Did it ever strike you,
reader, that some men and women seem to have
had a sunlight bath before entering this world,
so destined are they to make everything around
them pure and good; while others, wafted from
the regions of gloom, cast all around them the
shadow of death? Into this baleful darkness had
the young bride fallen, and in it her spirit had
been quenched. She loved her husband truly,
that tall, bronzed man, who had come from the
Indies to woo her in the sunny lanes of her
own England. Right glad, too, had she been to
become mistress of his old home. For months,
no spot had come on their home-picture. He
was happy in his treasure; she, too, in her
simple life in the village, where, from her
kindness, she already was receiving the homage
due to a queen. But one day, when the snow
was on the ground and the flowers were dead,
a woman came to the Old House in the Hollow.
She was dark, and radiantly beautiful, with the
beauty that blossoms under western skies. She
neither asked nor received leave to stay as a
member of the family circle in the old house,
but there was no one to oppose her action. The
master was her cousin, she said; and even as she
spoke, the gleam in her eyes gave her words the
lie. Yet he said nothing, for suddenly he had
grown silent and cold, avoiding even the wistful,
questioning glances of his wife.</p>

<p>The shadow spread slowly over the house, up
the staircases, into the nooks and corners of
the rooms, laying its black hand now on this
and now on that, but nowhere so strongly as on
the heart of the young mistress. Her rippling
laughter changed to sighs, her bright smiles
were replaced by downcast looks; she passed
from summer to winter with no mellowing
autumn days to make the change less sad. It
was not that the woman, who had come so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">{543}</span>
strangely, sought the love of her husband, or in
any other way attempted to dispel the sunshine
of her life; she simply dwelt with them, nay,
was friendly enough at times; but the dark
dress which she wore, and the masses of dark
hair which at times she would let fall about
her shoulders, seemed indicative of the moral
cloud which was slowly gathering over their
lives. The lily drooped day by day for want
of sunlight. She became morbid, nervous, full
of strange and wayward fancies. She thought
the love of her husband was dead; and she took
to dressing herself in her wedding garb, to try
if by that strange way she might make it
live again. Clad in the soft, lustrous satins—in
which as a happy bride she had blushed and
smiled in the little English church but a few
months before—she would pace her room for
hours, and stand, too, longingly before the glass,
peering wistfully to see if aught of her charm
were gone. In this garb, too, she would walk
among the old trees, and deck her bosom with
the snowdrops of spring; but they seemed to
wither away at her touch and hang listless
and dead. Thus it was, one day she was
found sitting among the trees on the fresh
spring grass, some faded snowdrops in her
lifeless hand, her golden hair surmounting a
face darkened with some mysterious presence.
A pale gleam of spring sunlight had crept
down and settled on her brow; but it was
out of place, and timid as the sunbeams
which I have seen playing on the old house
itself.</p>

<p>Thus quietly as the gliding of a river did
her spirit depart, or rather was effaced, as
a cloud can hide the silver moon from us
for a time. And so, they tell me, she can be
seen at times in the old garden, just as, when
the clouds grow faint, the welcome shafts of
light come down to assure us that their mother
orb still lives.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="QUARANTINE">QUARANTINE.</h2>
</div>
<p class="ph3">BY AN EXAMINING OFFICER.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> a time when every one has been anxiously
perusing the daily accounts of the increase or
abatement of cholera in European towns, and
when there exists a lurking fear lest the dreaded
scourge should obtain a footing on our shores,
a brief description of the precautions taken
against such a visitation may possibly prove
interesting to your readers. The majority of
people have, of course, a hazy idea that vessels
from Southern France are not allowed to slip
in and out of the United Kingdom without
strict examination as to the possibility of cholera
or other disease existing on board. They know
that there is some action taken bearing the old-fashioned
title of ‘Quarantine,’ and that it relates
to the isolation of vessels on board which disease
may exist; but with this knowledge, in a majority
of instances their information ends. This
very haziness thus induces unfounded fear—and
fear supplies one of the chief ingredients on
which cholera may be most bountifully fed. If
I can in any way lessen this apprehension by
detailing, as briefly as possible, the close supervision
to which vessels from foreign ports—just
now from the south of France especially—are
subjected, the purpose of this article will be fully
realised.</p>

<p>‘Quarantine,’ according to the lexicographers,
‘is the term during which a ship arriving in
port, and suspected of being infected with a
malignant, contagious disease, is obliged to forbear
all intercourse with the shore.’ Thus a
ship arriving in the United Kingdom at the
present time, and having on board, or suspected
of having on board, a case of cholera, would be
at once cut off from all intercourse with the
shore or with any neighbouring vessel. This
‘cutting-off’ process was in olden times much
more cumbrously managed than at present. Then,
the quarantine stations round the shores of Great
Britain were not only numerous, but were themselves
a source of danger to all concerned. Now,
the only one of the old quarantine stations of the
United Kingdom is that of the Mother-bank, in
the Isle of Wight, where are located three unemployed
men-of-war, having on board a staff of
officers and men with all appliances necessary
for dealing with vessels placed in quarantine.
These vessels, I understand, have only been
called into requisition on twelve occasions during
the last twenty years. The place for the performance
of quarantine at any port is now generally
decided by the Local Authority of that port
in conjunction with the officers of Customs who
may be stationed there. Her Majesty’s Privy
Council are, of course, primarily responsible for
the due carrying out of the quarantine regulations;
but on the officers of Customs depends the
detention of any vessel, pending the decision of
the higher authorities regarding such detention.
To enable the officer of Customs to act with
authority in the matter, he is provided with a
‘Quarantine Commission,’ on the faith of which
he can detain any vessel arriving from abroad
on board of which he may suspect the existence
of cholera or other infectious disease.</p>

<p>I will suppose, now, a vessel arriving in the
Mersey, the Thames, the Tyne, or other busy
shipping centre. The vessel, with her national
ensign flying aft, to denote that she is from a
foreign port—let us suppose a port infected with
cholera—sails or steams up to a position some
distance from the shore, termed the ‘boarding
station.’ Here the master must ‘bring to’ under
a penalty of one hundred pounds. The Customs
officers come alongside in their boat; and before
any one goes on board, the following questions
are put to the master: ‘What is the name of
the vessel and of the master? From what port
have you come? Was there any sickness at the
port while you were lying there or at the time
you left it? Have you any Bill of Health?—if
so, produce it. What number of officers, crew,
and passengers have you on board? Have any
of them suffered from any kind of illness during
the voyage?—if so, state it, however trifling it
may have been. Is every person on board in good
health at this moment?’ Should the master
refuse to answer any of these questions, or give
a false answer to any of them, the refusal
or falsehood subjects him to a penalty of one
hundred pounds; and if the questions have been
put upon oath and he returns a false answer, he
is liable to punishment for wilful and corrupt
perjury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">{544}</span></p>

<p>Should the answers of the master be deemed
unsatisfactory, and should the officer of Customs
suspect the existence of cholera on board, he at
once detains the vessel and apprises the Local
Authority, in order that its medical officer may
inspect the vessel, and decide whether or not the
suspicions of the officer of Customs are well
founded. If, however, the Local Authority <i>fails
to have such inspection carried out within twelve
hours</i>—and local Sanitary Boards would do well
to bear this fact in mind—the officer of Customs
<i>does not possess the power to detain the vessel
longer</i>, but must, on the expiration of the said
twelve hours, release the vessel from detention.
Thus it becomes of the utmost importance that,
for the safety of the community, local sanitary
authorities should see that the medical inspection
is carried out with all despatch.</p>

<p>The inspection being completed, and cholera,
we will suppose, being found to exist, the vessel
is obliged to proceed at once to the quarantine
station selected. Every person on board must
remain there until the vessel is released. Should
any one choose to disobey the law and endeavour
to escape, he or she incurs a heavy money penalty,
with the alternative of six months’ imprisonment.
This is mild punishment, indeed, to that
inflicted in the days of our forefathers, when
disobedience to quarantine laws subjected the
offender ‘to suffer death without benefit of clergy.’
Still, it is heavy enough to discourage any
attempt at disobedience, when such disobedience
would bring upon the transgressor the full rigour
of the law. Compared with quarantine punishments
in other countries, our penalty is, nevertheless,
in my opinion, far too lenient. I have known
of sailors in the Mediterranean who had left
their vessel after she had been placed in quarantine,
narrowly escaping being shot dead on the
spot. This ‘speedy despatch’ would not, of
course, be altogether in accord with our British
system of punishment; yet I can conceive no
greater crime than that of risking the propagation
of disease in a locality which till then had
been free from it. Nothing short of a lengthened
period of imprisonment is adequate punishment
for a crime so heinous.</p>

<p>To leave the particular case of cholera-infected
vessels, it may be advisable to have
a last word on foreign arrivals generally. In
the questions noted above which are put to
the master of a vessel on arrival in the United
Kingdom, there occurs the query, ‘Have you
any Bill of Health?’ Most people will probably
be inclined to inquire what a Bill of Health
consists of. Bills of Health are of two classes—namely,
clean bills of health and foul bills
of health. The former is a document signed
by a British consul abroad testifying that there
was no disease on board the vessel, or at the
port at which the vessel loaded her cargo for
the homeward voyage. The latter is a similar
document testifying that there has been disease
on board, or at the port of lading, or at any
of the ports at which the vessel may have
touched on her way home. A clean Bill of
Health, issued at Gibraltar a fortnight ago,
lies before me as I write, and thereon it is
certified in unmistakable English that ‘good
health is enjoyed in the city and garrison of
Gibraltar, and that there does not exist therein
plague, Asiatic cholera, or yellow fever; as
witness the seal of the said city and garrison
hereupon engraved.’ A vessel possessing a testimony
similar to this is, generally speaking,
free from the trouble and annoyance of quarantine;
but were the Bill of Health a foul one, the
case would be widely different. With the latter
on board, the display of the dreaded yellow flag
with the black ball in the centre at the main
topmast head makes quarantine almost a foregone
conclusion.</p>

<p>To narrate the numerous other duties of shipmasters,
of pilots, and of passengers in connection
with vessels liable to quarantine, is scarcely
possible within the limits of the present paper.
Their duties, indeed, would be understood only
by the initiated; and an attempt at a popular
translation of very dry and wordy regulations
would be utterly frustrated by the introduction
of uninteresting technicalities. In conclusion,
let me ask readers to reflect that not a single
vessel comes near our shores that is not
thoroughly investigated with regard to the existence
of infectious disease, and, by such reflection,
to banish those unwholesome fears which
do more than anything else to foster cholera
or any similar scourge.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &bull; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
